# BCI-controlled-Bot

## Introduction
People with disabilities can find it difficult to move from one
place to another without the help of others. This project aims
to give an alternative easy way for navigation using mobile
robot that can be controlled by the brain wirelessly in a range
of 1500 meters in the eyesight. this approach can be used in
wheel chairs that can be controlled to bring things to the patient
without himself move physically from his place.

## Project description
Wireless controlled robot that is controlled using brain signals obtained from EEG sensors.
– Hardware used: Emotiv epoch+ headset, Arduino, Cyton motor drivers, Xbee(for wireless interface between
arduino and the laptop)
– Software and SDKs used: Emotiv SDK, Emotiv EmoKey, Arduino language, XCTU.
